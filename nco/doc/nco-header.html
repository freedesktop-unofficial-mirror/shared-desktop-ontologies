<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> NEPOMUK Contact Ontology
describes contact information, common in many places on the desktop. It
evolved from the VCARD specification (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2426.txt">RFC 2426</a>)
and has been inspired by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf">Vcard Ontology</a>
by Renato Ianella. The scope of NCO is much broader though. This
document gives an overview of the classes, properties and intended use
cases of the NCO ontology.

<h2 id="sec-intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The purpose of the Nepomuk Contact Ontology (NCO) is to describe
contact information. It is one of the core elements of every Personal
Information Management system and Nepomuk is no exception. Origins of
this ontology can be traced back to VCARD specification published in [<a href="#ref-rfc2426">RFC2426</a>]. The first attempt to
convert RFC 2426 to RDF was made by Renato Ianella and published in a
W3C working group note [<a href="#ref-vcardrdf">VCARDRDF</a>].
This ontology doesn't meet Nepomuk requirements though. Most of the
properties don't have their domains and ranges set. It uses certain
modelling techniques that result in untyped blank nodes. Those few
range constraints that have been set are violated
in the examples provided with the specification document. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
All of this led to a decision to create a new ontology. This
opportunity has been used to fill in the missing domain and range
constraints and to expand the ontology with the concepts of Roles and
arbitrary contact media. It came at a cost of reduced compatibility
with the VCARD specification. The goal was to allow for lossless import
of vCard data. Exporting vCard files might require discarding some
information, since NCO is more expressive.

<h2><a name="sec-scope">2. Scope</a></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a name="sec-scope">The meaning of the term 'Contact' in
NCO is quite wide. It is every piece of data that identifies an entity
or provides means to communicate with it. This definition has two
aspects - identification and communication. NCO covers both of them.<br />

</a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a name="sec-scope"><img style="width: 512px; height: 366px;" alt="NCO Scope" src="scopeOfNco.png" /></a></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a name="sec-scope">A very high level diagram of the scope
of NCO is outlined in the figure above. It has two axes: content and
complexity. The vertical one refers to the various kinds of entities
mentioned in the definition of a Contact. They include people and
organizations but in a general case anything that can be contacted, can
be represented by an instance of the Contact class. This generality is
justified by
the fact, that in many cases automatic agents can be contacted with
various means.
Many companies operate automatic IVR systems the users may call to
obtain information or place orders. Emails are sent by various software
systems to notify the recipient of some event. In all of these cases, a
user might want to reprent such entities on a contact list, even though
they are neither people, nor organizations.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a name="sec-scope">The horizontal axis represents the
broad spectrum of use cases for this ontology. The left end is intended
to cover simple bits of information about contacts. Such information is
usually found in various places on a desktop. Recipients of emails,
authors of documents, attendees of calendar events. All of
these small pieces of data refer to Contacts, even though they are not
parts of a typical addressbook or a Contact list.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a name="sec-scope">The rightmost end of the horizontal
axis represents cases where a Contact refers
to an entry in an Addressbook. There are numerous applications that
allow the user to manage a list of contacts. They usually store many
pieces of data. In many cases a single person appears in various roles,
as a private person and as an employee of a company or an organization.
These roles are usually connected with their own addresses (private and
business), telephone numbers, email addresses etc. Cases when a person
is affiliated with multiple organizations make the matters even more
complicated. NCO tries to provide means to express this role-based
approach.

<h2><a name="sec-description">3. Description of
classes and properties</a></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a name="sec-description">The most important classes are
outlined in the Figure below.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a name="sec-description"></a><img style="width: 476px; height: 326px;" alt="NCO Classes" src="ncoMainClassDiagram.png" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="#Contact">Contact</a> is the core class of
NCO. It provides various properties for the purpose of identifying an
entity. They include mostly names, either as one string - (<a href="#fullname">fullname</a> or split into
constituent parts - <a href="#nameFamily">nameFamily</a>,
<a href="#nameGiven">nameGiven</a> etc).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The communication information is expressed with subclasses of the <a href="#ContactMedium">ContactMedium</a>
class. They provide various means of communication. An entire hierarchy
of various ContactMedia has been presented. Available subclasses
include: <a href="#PostalAddress">PostalAddress</a>,
<a href="#PhoneNumber">PhoneNumber</a>, <a href="#EmailAddress">EmailAddress</a>, and <a href="#IMAccoung">IMAccount</a>. Each medium is
equipped with specific properties. For instance the PostalAddress can
be split into various parts, an IMAccount has
an <a href="#imID">instant messaging identifier</a>,
a <a href="#imStatus">status</a> and a status
message <a href="#imStatusMessage">status message</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A single <a href="#Contact">Contact</a> has one
default role (expressed by the fact that the Contact class is a
subclass of <a href="#Role">Role</a>. This makes it
easier to use Contacts in places where little information is available
(leftmost end of the complexity axis). When contacts are extracted from
places where they are described in more detail (rightmost end of the
complexity axis) the distinction between multiple roles can be
expressed. NCO provides means to describe contact information to a
person (<a href="#PersonContact">PersonContact</a>
class that is affiliated (<a href="#Affiliation">Affiliation</a>)
with multiple Organizations (<a href="#OrganizationContact">OrganizationContact</a>).
</p>

<a name="sec-usage"></a>
<h2><a name="sec-usage">4. Usage</a></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a name="sec-usage">As already mentioned the definition of
a Contact is intentionally broad. NCO is intended to cover a wide array
of use cases. The most obvious one is description
of entries found in addressbooks. There are many applications that work
with such data. The list includes, but is certainly not limited to
email clients, calendaring applications, standalone addressbook
applications and online social services (like </a><a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Addressbook entries are not the only way to use NCO. Instances of the
Contact class may come up in many other places, as senders and
receivers of emails, as meeting attendees, as fileOwners etc. It is
considered a best practice to use an
instance of the Contact class wherever some contactable entity is
referenced, even when the point where this reference is made contains
little other information. See the list of properties that have <a href="#Contact">Contact</a> as their domain for ideas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The NCO is a good example of the trend towards <a href="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/nie#sec-integration">ontology
integration</a>.
To illustrate the effect of it let's consider a contact disambiguation
tool. It would browse all instances of the class Contact and aggregate
those that refer to one Person (by email address or various forms of
name). Such a tool wouldn't need to be aware of all properties in all
ontologies that even though they have a plain String as their range -
actually indicate a name of a person. If we left the names and email
addresses as plain string values of specialized properties - it would
become much more difficult to assign them to appropriate people
automatically.

<h2><a name="sec-examples">5. Examples</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
  	<b><a href="examples/nco-contact.ttl">nco-contact.ttl</a></b><br />
  	A simple NCO Contact. It represents an individual, with some contact media
  	affiliated with an organization. His work address and telephone is also
  	expressed.
  </li>
  <li>
  	<b><a href="examples/nco-key.ttl">nco-key.ttl</a></b><br />
  	Demonstrates how to attach information about public keys. NCO doesn't have
  	any particular vocabulary for elements of public keys. A key is treated as
  	an attachment file. Future NIE extensions may add more expressive vocabulary
  	for this.
  </li>
  <li>
  	<b><a href="examples/nco-photossounds.ttl">nco-photossounds.ttl</a></b><br />
  	Demonstrates how to attach information about photos and sounds to a contact.
  	They are also expressed as attachments, but NIE provides vocabulary that can
  	be used to interpret those attachments as InformationElements of a concrete
  	type.
