\section{Introduction}

This is going to be an introduction about pimo.

\subsection{Scope of the PIMO}
% SOURCE1 copied from Leos Dissertation & PIMO Paper / Ludger
The motivation for creating the PIMO is to find a language to name the terms
that are relevant to a knowledge worker and to have ways to express facts about
these terms. Once this language is defined and formalized in the ontological
description of the PIMO, it can be used to translate existing resources, and to
express information about them. The PIMO is a user-centric view on existing
documents, domain ontologies, and web data sources.

While the organization asks for universally applicable and standardized
persistent structures, processes, and work organizations to achieve and
maintain universally accessible information archives, the individual knowledge
worker requests individualized structures and flexibility in processes and work
organization in order to reach optimal support for the individual activities.

The \emph{Personal Information Model (PIMO)} as created in the EPOS project was
driven by four requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sound formal basis: The PIMO must support various knowledge
  services, among them logics-based services (e.g., ontology-based information
  retrieval). Therefore, the PIMO must employ an expressive representation language and
  has to wipe out the contradictions and redundancies of the native structures.
  \item Bridge between individual and organizational Knowledge Management:
  The PIMO has to incorporate global ontologies, but also has
  to reflect the changes and updates of native structures. The PIMO itself should
  be a source of input for OM-wide ontologies.
  \item Maintenance: Adequate means have to be provided that assist the user with
  stepwise formalization of native structures and inspection of the PIMO.
\end{itemize}
% END OF SOURCE1

Features that the PIMO has to realize are based on requirements from the user side.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Representing Things: Represent things of interest. 
	\item Uniqueness and merging: two information elements that represent the same thing have to be mapped to one entity.
	\item Relations: Links between things have to be browseable, properties should have inverse relations defined (see \cite{rohmer2005})
	\item Extensibility: Users are free to add new relation types and new classes (see \cite{rohmer2005})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open Questions to be addressed}
A few questions are solved by the PIMO approach, these can be asked by programmers, knowledge engineers, 
or end-users of Semantic Desktops.

\begin{description}
	\item[What classes and instances appear in a user interface?] 
	Assumed that many classes and instances are stored in an available RDF data store, 
	what classes and instances should be shown to the user? Are all of them of interest? 
	When applying filter rules, should the filter rules be excluding 
	(not wanted classes are filtered out) or including (wanted classes are filtered in).
	\item[]
\end{description}

\section{Description}

This is going to be a description of PIMO with some informal overview of the classes and properties. Maybe some diagrams.
