	content primarily intended for machine consumption in a human-readable

	high-level issues, no matter the underlying representation paradigm:
	specifying (i) what information contained in RDF models should be
	presented (content selection) and (ii) how this information should
	be presented (content formatting and styling). However, each tool
	currently relies on its own ad hoc mechanisms and vocabulary for
	specifying RDF presentation knowledge, making it difficult to share
	and reuse such knowledge across applications. Recognizing the general
	need for presenting RDF content to users and wanting to promote
	the exchange of presentation knowledge, we designed Fresnel as a
	browser-independent vocabulary of core RDF display concepts. In
	this paper we describe Fresnel‚Äôs main concepts and present several
	RDF browsers and visualization tools that have adopted the vocabulary

  title = {Human Computation},
  school = {School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University},
  year = {2005},
  month = {December},
  abstract = {Tasks like image recognition are trivial for humans, but continue
	to challenge even the most sophisticated computer programs. This
	thesis introduces a paradigm for utilizing human processing power
	to solve problems that computers cannot yet solve. Traditional approaches
	to solving such problems focus on improving software. I advocate
	a novel approach: constructively channel human brainpower using
	computer games. For example, the ESP Game, introduced in this thesis,
	is an enjoyable online game -- many people play over 40 hours a
	week -- and when people play, they help label images on the Web
	with descriptive keywords. These keywords can be used to significantly
	improve the accuracy of image search. People play the game not because
	they want to help, but because they enjoy it.
	
	
	I introduce three other examples of "games with a purpose": Peekaboom,
	which helps determine the location of objects in images, Phetch,
	which collects paragraph descriptions of arbitrary images to help
	accessibility of the Web, and Verbosity, which collects "common-sense"
	knowledge.
	
	
	In addition, I introduce CAPTCHAs, automated tests that humans can
	pass but computer programs cannot. CAPTCHAs take advantage of human
	processing power in order to differentiate humans from computers,an
	ability that has important applications in practice.
	
	
	The results of this thesis are currently in use by hundreds of Web
	sites and companies around the world, and some of the games presented
	here have been played by over 100,000 people. Practical applications
	of this work include improvements in problems such as: image search,
	adult-content filtering, spam, commonsense reasoning, computer vision,
	accessibility, and security in general.},

	(as far as I know, except for Dan Connolly's Larch work [@@]), until
	the Semantic Web introduced languages such as RDF which have well-defined
	logical properties and are used to describe (among other things)
	web operations.
	
	
	The efforts of the Technical Architecture Group to create an architecture

	the ambiguity of natural language that no significant problem had
	been noticed over the past decade, even though the original author

  abstract = {The Resource Description Framework and the SPARQL query language provide
	a standardized way for exposing and linking data sources on the
	Web. D2R Server is a turn-key solution for making the content of
	existing, non-RDF databases accessible as SPARQL endpoints. The
	server takes SPARQL queries from the Web and rewrites them via a
	mapping into SQL queries against a relational database. This on-the-fly
	translation allows RDF applications to access the content of large
	databases without having to replicate them into RDF. D2R Server
	can be used to integrate existing databases into RDF systems, and
	to add SPARQL interfaces to database-backed software products. In
	the talk, we will give an introduction into the D2RQ mapping language,
	which is used to define mappings between relational and RDF schemata,
	and demonstrate how D2R Server can be used to extend a WordPress
	blog with a SPARQL interface.},

  abstract = {Personal InformationManagement (PIM) describes the acquisition, organization,
	and retrieval of information by an individual computer user. Studies
	have shown that many users struggle to manage the volume and diversity
	of information that they accumulate. Much design activity has been
	aimed at improving integration between different PIM tools, such
	as file and email managers. However, in terms of making a systematic
	contribution to HCI knowledge, much of this cross-tool design can
	be criticised for a lack of empirical grounding and evaluation.
	
	The research described in this thesis employs a user-centered design
	methodology to deepen understanding of PIM, and in particular to
	provide guidance for PIM-integration design. The research is grounded
	in an exploratory study of file, email and bookmark management,
	which is differentiated from previous studies by its cross-tool
	nature. The study offers several contributions including observations
	of participants‚Äô multiple organizing strategies ‚Äì in both toolspecific
	and cross-tool contexts. Also, many participants had significant
	numbers of overlapping folders that appeared in multiple tool contexts.
	This finding informs the design of WorkspaceMirror, a novel PIM-integration
	prototype, which allows a user to mirror changes between their file,
	email and bookmark folders. 
	
	The final stage of the research is a dual-purpose field study, aimed
	at (1) evaluatingWorkspaceMirror, and (2) investigating PIM behaviour
	over time. Participant feedback indicates that mirroring is more
	appropriate for top-level folders, and illuminates a trade-off between
	organizational consistency and organizational flexibility. The study
	also reveals the incremental nature of changes in organizing strategy,
	and highlights the supporting nature of PIM. These and other empirical
	findings are used to improve previous descriptive models of PIM
	behaviour. Furthermore, a number of design and methodological guidelines
	are developed. In particular, the author emphasizes the importance
	of assessing the strengths and weaknesses of PIM designs from both
	tool-specific and cross-tool perspectives.},

	the Web with machine-processable semantic data. We have developed
	Sesame, an architecture for ecient storage and expressive querying
	of large quantities of metadata in RDF and RDF Schema. Sesame's
	design and implementation are independent from any speci c storage
	device. Thus, Sesame can be deployed on top of a variety of storage
	devices, such as relational databases, triple stores, or object-oriented
	databases, without having to change the query engine or other functional
	modules. Sesame o ers support for concurrency control, independent
	export of RDF and RDFS information and a query engine for RQL, a
	query language for RDF that o ers native support for RDF Schema
	semantics. We present an overview of Sesame as a generic architecture,
	as well as its implementation and our rst experiences with this

	Wide Web has ironically become more efficient than searching one‚Äôs

	is actually quite different from its web counterpart. Documents
	on the desktop are not linked to each other in a way comparable
	to the web, which means that result ranking is poor or even inexistent,
	because algorithms like PageRank cannot be used for desktop search.
	On the other hand, desktop search could potentially profit from
	a lot of implicit and explicit semantic information available in

	in digital form has made search a hot research

	While most of the research on search is focussed on
	
	the WWW, individual computer users have developed
	
	their own vast collections of data on their desktops,
	
	and these collections are in critical need for good
	
	search tools.
	
	We describe the Semex System that offers users
	
	a flexible platform for personal information management.
	
	Semex has two main goals. The first goal is to
	
	enable browsing personal information by semantically
	
	meaningful associations. The challenge it to automatically
	
	create such associations between data items on
	
	one's desktop, and to create enough of them so Se-
	
	mex becomes an indispensable tool. Our second goal
	
	is to leverage the personal information space we created
	
	to increase users' productivity. As our first target,
	
	Semex leverages the personal information to enable
	
	lightweight information integration tasks that are
	
	discouragingly diffcult to perform with today's tools.},

	Desktop, the PIMO (Personal Information Model Ontology) addresses
	this problem by providing a generic lightweight ontology whose classes
	model the mian concepts involved in the daily activities of a person:
	places, organizations, persons, etc. But in order to be fully useful

	judged by its ease of use for developers, the completeness of the

	the design implemented may be judged a partial success, achieving
	an easy-to-use reflection which is practically too slow to use in
	general purpose systems. The work does, however, suggest means to
	improve this in future systems in order to bring about a fully-integrated,

  abstract = {To date, RDF has not been clear about whether a URI like "http://www.w3.org/Consortium"
	identifies the W3C or a web page about the W3C. Throughout RDF,
	strings like "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type" are
	used with no consistent explanation of how they relate to the web.
	This is an old issue, and people are tired of it, but the issue
	continues to complicate the lives of RDF users. As more people author
	RDF information, it becomes more important for everyone to have
	a consistent idea of how RDF identifiers relate to the real things
	which people are using RDF to talk about.
	
	
	I propose we officially recognize this ambiguity. I also propose a
	way to settle it which is compatible with nearly all deployed systems
	and data. Finally, I explore a mechanism (some new predicates) to
	let people be explicit about URI usage in when necessary.
	
	
	The changes to the current draft RDF documents should be small. I
	have not yet constructed the exact revisions required, but I think
	they are mostly in RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax, section 2.4.3
	Interaction between social and formal meaning. If the new predicates
	are adopted by RDF Core, they would require some wider changes,
	but they could probably go into another namespace and Recomendation.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web Initiative envisions a Web wherein information is
	offered free of presentation, allowing more effective exchange and
	mixing across web sites and across web pages. But without substantial
	Semantic Web content, few tools will be written to consume it; without
	many such tools, there is little appeal to publish Semantic Web
	content. To break this chicken-and-egg problem, thus enabling more
	flexible informa-tion access, we have created a web browser extension
	called Piggy Bankthat lets users make use of Semantic Web content
	within Web content as users browse the Web. Wherever Semantic Web
	content is not available, Piggy Bank can invoke screenscrapers to
	re-structure information within web pages into Semantic Web format.
	Through the use of Semantic Web technologies, Piggy Bank provides
	direct, immediate benefits to users in their use of the existing
	Web. Thus, the ex-istence of even just a few Semantic Web-enabled
	sites or a few scrapers already benefits users. Piggy Bank thereby
	offers an easy, incremental upgrade path to users without requiring
	a wholesale adoption of the Semantic Web‚Äôs vision. To further improve
	this Semantic Web experience, we have created Semantic Bank, a web
	server application that lets Piggy Bank users share the Semantic
	Web information they have collected, enabling collaborative efforts
	to build so-phisticated Semantic Web information repositories through
	simple, everyday‚Äôs use of Piggy Bank.},

  abstract = {The semantic desktop aims at handling files as resources of a desktop
	ontology. This ontology captures a mental model of how the user
	conceptualizes files, and serves to re-interpret current file operations
	in a semantic manner. Now, a ``.doc'' artifact is not a mere file
	but a resource of the knowledge base. The user no longer creates
	a ``.doc'' file but an instance of, for instance, the Deliverable
	ontological class. Likewise, zipping operations do not require selecting
	one-at-a-time the files to be zipped together but semantic associations
	can be automatically traversed to locate the resources to be zipped.
	This paper presents seMouse, a realization of this vision where
	the mouse acts as a bridge between the traditional file world and
	the ontology realm. This accounts for a dual perspective of desktop
	resources. As files, traditional tooling is available (e.g. the
	Word editor). As resources, ``the semantic mouse'' permits to re-interpret
	traditional file operations from a semantic perspective whereby
	resource edition, classification, copying or ziping benefit from
	the underlying ontology. Keywords: I.2.12 Intelligent Web services

	facts returned are retrieved from a formalized knowledge repository

  title = {kSpaces: A Distributed Knowledge Management Platform},
  school = {Department of Computing Science, University of Aberdeen},
  year = {2004},
  type = {Master Thesis},
  abstract = {kSpaces is a metadata-driven, distributed knowledge management platform.
	It was designed to be lightweight, transparent and extensible. The
	kSpaces proof-of-concept allows files to be described with arbitrary
	RDF (http://www.w3.org/RDF/) metadata. These descriptions can then
	be easily shared with and queried by other nodes in the system.
	Finally, kSpaces-managed files can be made available to all other
	nodes participating in the same kSpace. kSpaces employs file system
	monitoring and auto-tagging technologies in order to achieve almost
	full transparency to the user. Its lightweight, plugin-based design
	allows for maximum extensibility. The kSpaces reference implementation
	was written using Java for the server and C# for the client (on
	Microsoft's .NET platform). All client-server communication is done
	via SOAP (http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/), and client-client data transfers
	are made via HTTP. The kSpaces Node software works by monitoring
	a directory (My kSpace in the My Documents folder) and managing
	metadata about any files in that directory. Subdirectories are not
	supported. kSpaces automatically tags files through the use of plugins.
	The two autotagging plugins that are included analyze a file's ID3
	(http://www.id3.org/) and EXIF (http://www.exif.org/) headers, and
	then generate the appropriate RDF metadata. Metadata associated
	with a file can be viewed and edited through the kSpaces Node application,
	supported by editor plugins. Five editor plugins have been included
	in the proof-of-concept, four of which are read only. These plugins
	allow the management of a subset of Dublin Core (http://www.dublincore.org/)
	metadata, EXIF metadata, ID3 metadata and kSpaces-specific metadata.
	The Raw RDF plugin shows the raw RDF metadata associated with a
	knowledge asset. The metadata that is stored about knowledge assets
	in a kSpace can be queried using RDQL (http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/rdql.htm).
	In end-user applications, RDQL could be generated by using natural
	language processing or other technologies. Finally, the kSpaces
	node allows the kSpace contents to be viewed using browsing plugins.
	In this proof-of-concept, only a very basic one has been provided,
	which shows all assets present in the kSpace. Writing additional
	browsing plugins will allow users to see the kSpace assets from
	different facets that can be tailored to the user's needs.},

  abstract = {As with every major intellectual effort, there is a story behind this
	work as well.
	
	Following four years of education in Computer Science at the E√∂tv√∂s
	Lor√°nd Tudom√°ny Egyetem (ELTE) in Budapest and a year at the Vrije
	Universiteit in Amsterdam (VUA), just like my peers, I had the obligation
	to complete a thesis work for a Master's degree in Computer Science.
	Unlike my peers, however, I was not only looking for a topic, but
	planned to find a related internship as well: I considered that
	a guarantee that the topic I chose would have a practical value
	beyond an exercise per se. 
	
	In my quest I had the fortune to meet Frank van Harmelen from the
	Artificial Intelligence Department of the VUA. He not only offered
	me a topic and an internship to go with it, but also helped me to
	joining one of the most reputable research collaboration in the
	field of Semantic Web [29] technologies and applications. He also
	introduced me to Hans Akkermans from the Business Informatics Department
	of the VUA who helped as an advisor during my work. I started in
	January 2002 at EnerSearch, a Swedish case study partner in the
	On-To-Knowledge research project. In order to avoid relocation,
	AIdministrator (another partner in the project) generously hosted
	me for the duration of my work. 
	
	For the following six month I had been vested the responsibility to
	assemble the components developed in the project into a comprehensive
	solution for EnerSearch. With very few experience available to build
	on, my task was rightfully expected to be a challenge and an immense
	learning endeavor. While strenuous at times and fun at others, it
	altogether gave me a unique insight into some of the most exciting
	technologies in AI today and provided the wealth of experience that
	is captured in the following thesis.},

  address = {Brisbane QLD Australia},
  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {The Semantic Web is an initiative that aims to enable data from different
	sources to be 
	
	combined in a consistent way. It is particularly useful when the schemas
	and terminologies of 
	
	different data sets are to be merged, or they differ between organisations
	or change over time. 
	
	Semantic Web technologies have been successfully applied to data integration
	in fields such as 
	
	Bio-Informatics, Life Sciences, GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
	and Material Sciences. 
	
	RDF is a simple graph-based data model for representing information
	on the Web. SPARQL 
	
	is the proposed standard for querying RDF and both are part of the
	W3C‚Äôs Semantic Web 
	
	Activity. 
	
	The current SPARQL specification shows a strong bias towards underlying
	implementations 
	
	(especially SQL) and lacks a formal model. A formal model would allow:
	
	
	‚Ä¢ Independence between implementation and specification, 
	
	‚Ä¢ Greater consistency with RDF, and 
	
	‚Ä¢ The ability to improve implementations without affecting the user‚Äôs
	view of the 
	
	system. 
	
	
	Previous work has highlighted the need for a formal model in order
	to improve consistency 
	
	and clarity of the existing specification. It is suggested that building
	SPARQL on the 
	
	relational model allows efficient query optimisation and distribution.
	
	
	This work provides a mapping from RDF and SPARQL that is consistent
	with the relational 
	
	model. The SPARQL operations UNION and OPTIONAL were implemented using
	the 
	
	relational operators outer union and minimum union respectively. This
	is based on previous 
	
	extensions to the relational model by Galindo-Legaria. Implementation
	details using Java and 
	
	the JRDF library are described including the use of an order independent
	minimum union 
	
	implementation, and the significant performance advantages of applying
	pre-existing relational 
	
	optimisation techniques is explored. 
	
	It is shown that by using the relational model as a basis for SPARQL
	it provides an easier to 
	
	implement, more efficient, more consistent and extensible query language
	than is currently 
	
	provided. It also allows the reuse of existing relational optimisation
	techniques as well as 
	
	being used a basis to extend SPARQL functionality.},

	attracting people who contribute their time and technical skills
	is of paramount importance, both in technical and economic terms.
	This reliance on volunteers leads to some fundamental management
	challenges: volunteer contributions are inherently difficult to
	predict, plan and manage, especially in the case of large projects.
	In this paper we analyze the evolution in time of the human resources
	of one of the largest and most complex libre software projects composed
	primarily of volunteers, the Debian project. Debian currently has
	around 1300 volunteers working on several tasks: much activity is
	focused on packaging software applications and libraries, but there
	is also major work related to the maintenance of the infrastructure
	needed to sustain the development. We have performed a quantitative
	investigation of data from almost seven years, studying how volunteer
	involvement has affected the software released, and the developer
	community itself.},

	a Personal Information Model (PIMO). It is matched both with personal
	resources (files, e-mails, and websites) of the user and organizational
	knowledge (ontologies). A user observation component gathers actions
	of the user to calculate the current context with regards to current
	goals and matching elements in the user‚Äôs PIMO. Combined, the representation
	of the user‚Äôs stored information and the current context provide
	a thorough representation of the user. Desktop applications can
	use this representation to provide personalized services. Three
	special purpose applications were implemented: a search engine,
	a context-sensitive assistant, and a tool for filing new information.
	An evaluation of this approach showed that it increases productivity
	and indeed reflects the subjective view of users. Also, the approach
	satisfies most of the requirements of an Adaptive Educational Hypermedia
	System AEHS. Parts of this work are published as open source projects.},

	information--information derived from data through a semantic theory
	for interpreting the symbols.This simple idea, however, remains
	largely unrealized. Shopbots and auction bots abound on the Web,
	but these are essentially handcrafted for particular tasks; they
	have little ability to interact with heterogeneous data and information
	types. Because we haven't yet delivered large-scale, agent-based
	mediation, some commentators argue that the Semantic Web has failed
	to deliver. We argue that agents can only flourish when standards
	are well established and that the Web standards for expressing shared
	meaning have progressed steadily over the past five years. Furthermore,
	we see the use of ontologies in the e-science community presaging
	ultimate success for the Semantic Web--just as the use of HTTP within
	the CERN particle physics community led to the revolutionary success
	of the original Web. This article is part of a special issue on

  journal = {Technology Radar},

  volume = {II},
  pages = {1-23},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) has drastically improved access to digitally
	stored information. However, content in the WWW has so far only
	been machine-readable but not machineunderstandable. Since information
	in the WWW is mostly represented in natural language, the available
	documents are only fully understandable by human beings. The Semantic
	Web is based on the content-oriented description of digital documents
	with standardized vocabularies that provide machine understandable
	semantics. The result is the transformation from a Web of Links
	into a Web of Meaning/Semantic Web [ ], (see arrow A in Fig. ).
	On the other hand, the traditional Web .0 has recently undergone
	an orthogonal shift into a Web of People/Web 2.0 where the focus
	is set on folksonomies, collective intelligence, and the wisdom
	of groups (see arrow B in Fig. ). Only the combined muscle of semantic
	web technologies and broad user participation will ultimately lead
	to a Web 3.0, with completely new business opportunities in all
	segments of the ITC market. Without Web 2.0 technologies and without
	activating the power of community-based semantic tagging, the emerging
	semantic web cannot be scaled and broadened to the level that is
	needed for a complete transformation of the current syntactic web.
	On the other hand, current Web 2.0 technologies cannot be used for
	automatic service composition and open domain query answering without
	adding machine-understandable content descriptions based on semantic
	web technologies. The ultimate worldwide knowledge infrastructure
	cannot be fully produced automatically but needs massive user participation
	based on open semantic platforms and standards. The interesting
	and urgent question that arises is: what happens when the emerging
	Semantic Web and Web 2.0 intersect with their full potential? We
	analyze this question throughout this feature paper and present
	the converging idea that we call Web 3.0. We use the following definition
	in this paper: Web 3.0 = Semantic Web + Web 2.0. A good example
	for developing Web 3.0 is the mobile personal information assistant
	(see Fig. 2). The user makes queries using natural language, and
	the assistant answers by extracting and combining information from
	the entire web, evaluating the information found while applying
	Semantic Web technologies. Today‚Äôs second-generation search engines
	are based on keywords within the syntactic web, while open domain
	question answering engines are based on information extraction and
	the Semantic Web.},

	information, in an industrial research environment. We examined
	the reasons people collect paper, types of data they collect, problems
	encountered in handling paper, and strategies used for processing
	it. We tested three specific hypotheses in the course of an office
	move. The greater availability of public digital data along with
	changes in people‚Äôs jobs or interests should lead to wholescale
	discarding of paper data, while preparing for the move. Instead
	we found workers kept large, highly valued paper archives. We also
	expected that the major part of people‚Äôs personal archives would
	be unique documents. However, only 49% of people‚Äôs archives were
	unique documents, the remainder being copies of publicly available
	data and unread information, and we explore reasons for this. We
	examined the effects of paper-processing strategies on archive structure.
	We discovered different paper-processing strategies ( filing and
	piling) that were relatively independent of job type. We predicted
	that filers‚Äô attempts to evaluate and categorize incoming documents
	would produce smaller archives that were accessed frequently. Contrary
	to our predictions, filers amassed more information, and accessed
	it less frequently than pilers. We argue that filers may engage
	in premature filing: to clear their workspace, they archive information
	that later turns out to be of low value. Given the effort involved
	in organizing data, they are also loath to discard filed information,
	even when its value is uncertain. We discuss the implications of
	this research for digital personal information management.},

	machine-readable data begins to appear on the web, it is typically
	distributed in a separate file, with a separate format, and very
	limited correspondence between the human and machine versions. As
	a result, web browsers can provide only minimal assistance to humans
	in parsing and processing web data: browsers only see presentation
	information. We introduce RDFa, which provides a set of XHTML attributes
	to augment visual data with machine-readable hints. We show how
	to express simple and more complex datasets using RDFa, and in particular
	how to turn the existing human-visible text and links into machine-readable
	data without repeating content.
	
	
	This document provides only a Primer to RDFa. The normative specification
	of RDFa can be found in [RDFA-SYNTAX].},
